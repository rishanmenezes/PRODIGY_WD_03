> Tic Tac Toe Web Application for my Web Development Internship at PRODIGY Infotech.

## ‚ú® Task Overview
**Objective:**
To build an interactive **Tic Tac Toe Web Application** that:
- Allows two players to play against each other.
- Implements logic to track the game state and check for winning conditions.
- Is styled to provide a clean and user-friendly interface.

## üîß Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For creating the structure of the game board and interface.  
- **CSS3**: For styling the game board and making the application visually appealing.  
- **JavaScript**: To implement the game logic, including user interactions, state tracking, and winner determination.  

## üìÇ Project Structure
- index.html      # Main HTML file for the game structure.
- styles.css      # CSS file for styling the Tic Tac Toe application.
- script.js       # JavaScript file for game functionality.
- README.md       # Documentation.

## üöÄ How to Run This Project
- Clone this repository:
- git clone https://github.com/rishanmenezes/PRODIGY_WD_03.git
- Open the project folder in a code editor (e.g., VS Code).
- Open index.html in a browser to play the game.

## üìñ What I Learned
- Building an interactive game interface using **HTML** and **CSS**.
- Writing **JavaScript** functions to handle:
  - User clicks and interactions.
  - Tracking the game state (whose turn it is and which cells are marked).
  - Checking for winning conditions (three in a row, column, or diagonal).
  - Resetting the game.
- Enhancing the user experience with responsive design and visual feedback.

## üéÆ Game Features
- **Two-player Mode**: Players take turns to place their markers (X or O).
- **Winner Detection**: Automatically detects and highlights the winning row, column, or diagonal.
- **Game Reset**: Allows players to reset the board for a new game.
